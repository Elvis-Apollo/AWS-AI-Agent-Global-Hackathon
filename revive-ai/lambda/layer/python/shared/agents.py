{full_analysis}

TASK:
Based on this intelligence, create the most effective 3-email win-back campaign. Use your expertise to:

1. Identify the ROOT CAUSE of churn (look beyond surface-level reasons)
2. Choose the right tone, messaging, and offers for THIS specific customer
3. Address their actual needs (e.g., if low adoption â†’ offer training/onboarding, NOT discounts)
4. Personalize with company name and specific context
5. Create compelling, authentic emails that maximize win-back probability

EMAIL SEQUENCE STRATEGY:
- Email 1 (Day 7): Gentle re-engagement, acknowledge their decision, show understanding
- Email 2 (Day 14): Address the ROOT CAUSE with concrete solutions
- Email 3 (Day 30): Compelling final offer or call to action

QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Subject: <50 characters, compelling, personalized to customer's company name
- Body: 150-300 words, professional but warm, specific to their situation
- CTA: Clear action, 3-7 words, relevant to their needs
- Write naturally from YOUR company's perspective using the company context provided above
- Reference your company name, product, and value proposition naturally when appropriate
- NEVER use placeholders like [Company Name], [Product], [Feature], etc. - use actual values provided
- Avoid: Generic templates, desperate tone, inappropriate offers, any placeholders or brackets
