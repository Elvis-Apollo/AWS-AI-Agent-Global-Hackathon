# Model Access Issue - Fixed

## Problem
The Coordinator and Campaign Generator agents were configured to use Claude 3.5 Sonnet (`us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0`), but this model requires explicit access request in the Bedrock console.

**Error:** `Access denied when calling Bedrock`

## Root Cause
In AWS Bedrock, you must request access to specific models before they can be used. The Churn Analyzer was working because it uses Claude 3.5 Haiku, which already has access granted.

## Solution
Updated all 3 agents to use **Claude 3.5 Haiku** (`us.anthropic.claude-3-5-haiku-20241022-v1:0`), which already has model access.

### Agents Updated:
1. ✅ **Churn Analyzer** - Already using Haiku (no change needed)
2. ✅ **Coordinator** - Changed from Sonnet to Haiku
3. ✅ **Campaign Generator** - Changed from Sonnet to Haiku

### Trade-offs:
**Original Plan:**
- Coordinator: Sonnet (better reasoning)
- Campaign Generator: Sonnet (better creative writing)
- Churn Analyzer: Haiku (cost-effective analysis)

**Current Setup (All Haiku):**
- ✅ Works immediately (no model access request needed)
- ✅ Faster responses (Haiku is faster than Sonnet)
- ✅ Lower cost (Haiku is cheaper)
- ⚠️ Slightly less sophisticated reasoning (but still very capable)

### Performance Notes:
Claude 3.5 Haiku is still a very powerful model and handles:
- Multi-agent orchestration ✓
- Strategic decision-making ✓
- Email campaign generation ✓
- JSON parsing and structured output ✓

For the hackathon demo, Haiku provides excellent performance and meets all requirements.

## Future: Upgrading to Sonnet (Optional)

If you want to use Sonnet for better quality:

### Step 1: Request Model Access
1. Go to AWS Console → Amazon Bedrock
2. Navigate to "Model access" in left sidebar
3. Click "Manage model access"
4. Find "Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2" in the list
5. Check the box next to it
6. Click "Request model access"
7. Wait 2-5 minutes for approval

### Step 2: Update Agents
```bash
# Update Coordinator to Sonnet
aws bedrock-agent update-agent \
  --agent-id UPWE8NQKWH \
  --agent-name "revive-ai-coordinator" \
  --agent-resource-role-arn "arn:aws:iam::292101577831:role/ReviveAI-BedrockAgentRole" \
  --foundation-model "us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0" \
  --instruction "<same instruction>" \
  --region us-east-1

# Update Campaign Generator to Sonnet
aws bedrock-agent update-agent \
  --agent-id HXMON0RCRP \
  --agent-name "revive-ai-campaign-generator" \
  --agent-resource-role-arn "arn:aws:iam::292101577831:role/ReviveAI-BedrockAgentRole" \
  --foundation-model "us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0" \
  --instruction "<same instruction>" \
  --region us-east-1

# Re-prepare agents
aws bedrock-agent prepare-agent --agent-id UPWE8NQKWH --region us-east-1
aws bedrock-agent prepare-agent --agent-id HXMON0RCRP --region us-east-1
```

## Current Status: ✅ READY TO TEST

All 3 agents are now using Claude 3.5 Haiku and are PREPARED.

**Test now:**
```bash
cd /Users/elvischen/Documents/PROJECTS/AWS\ AI\ Agent\ Global\ Hackathon/revive-ai/bedrock-agent

# If using Python test:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install boto3
python test_multi_agent.py
```

**Or test via AWS Console:**
1. Go to Bedrock → Agents → `revive-ai-coordinator`
2. Click Test tab
3. Enter a customer scenario
4. Watch it work!

---

**Models in Use:**
- Churn Analyzer: Claude 3.5 Haiku ✓
- Coordinator: Claude 3.5 Haiku ✓ (was Sonnet)
- Campaign Generator: Claude 3.5 Haiku ✓ (was Sonnet)

**Status:** All agents PREPARED and ready for multi-agent orchestration testing!
