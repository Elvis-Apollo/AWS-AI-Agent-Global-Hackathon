c501,founder@healthtechpro.com,HealthTech Pro,enterprise,4999,2025-10-12,"Platform complexity made it difficult for our team to adopt - spent 3 months trying to implement but only using 20% of features. Our staff couldn't figure out the API integration despite having experienced developers."
c502,cfo@retailwave.io,RetailWave Analytics,growth,1299,2025-10-13,"Budget constraints due to slower than expected Q4 sales. Love the product but need to cut costs. The $1299/month is too steep for our current runway, though we're seeing great value from the analytics."
c503,cto@finservai.com,FinServ AI Solutions,enterprise,5999,2025-10-11,"Missing real-time data streaming and webhook support which are critical for our financial services use case. Need sub-second latency and event-driven architecture. Competitor offers these features."
c504,sarah.jenkins@gmail.com,Sarah Jenkins,starter,29,2025-10-10,"I was using this for my side project blog but honestly it felt like overkill for what I needed. Too many features I will never use and the learning curve was steeper than expected. Found a simpler tool that does exactly what I need for 9 dollars per month."
c505,mike.rodriguez.dev@outlook.com,Mike Rodriguez,growth,79,2025-10-14,"Lost my freelance contract last month and need to reduce expenses while I search for new clients. Really like the platform and was getting great results but cannot justify the cost right now. Planning to come back once my income stabilizes."
