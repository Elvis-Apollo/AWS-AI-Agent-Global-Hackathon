## Appendix C: Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Technical Pitfalls

**❌ Pitfall 1: Overcomplicating Architecture**
- Don't build microservices for a hackathon
- Don't use multiple programming languages
- Don't implement complex state management
- ✅ Solution: Single Lambda, simple flow, minimal dependencies

**❌ Pitfall 2: Poor Error Handling**
- Bedrock API can fail or timeout
- S3 reads/writes can fail
- CSV parsing can encounter bad data
- ✅ Solution: Try/catch blocks, graceful degradation, clear error messages

**❌ Pitfall 3: Ignoring Rate Limits**
- Bedrock has request limits
- Too many concurrent calls = failures
- ✅ Solution: Process sequentially, add delays if needed, handle throttling

**❌ Pitfall 4: Not Testing on Demo Day Environment**
- Venue WiFi might be slow
- Projector resolution might differ
- Browser might be different version
- ✅ Solution: Test beforehand, have offline fallback, responsive design

**❌ Pitfall 5: Hardcoding Credentials**
- Never commit API keys to GitHub
- Don't hardcode bucket names
- ✅ Solution: Environment variables, AWS Secrets Manager, .env files

### Demo Pitfalls

**❌ Pitfall 6: Live Upload During Demo**
- File upload can fail
- Processing can timeout
- Network can drop
- ✅ Solution: "Load Demo Data" button with instant results

**❌ Pitfall 7: Too Much Text on Slides**
- Judges can't read and listen
- Looks unprofessional
- ✅ Solution: Images, bullet points, big numbers, minimal text

**❌ Pitfall 8: Technical Jargon Overload**
- "Our Lambda invokes Bedrock via boto3 SDK..."
- Most judges aren't engineers
- ✅ Solution: "Our AI agents analyze and generate campaigns..."

**❌ Pitfall 9: Not Practicing Demo**
- Fumbling through UI
- Forgetting what to say
- Missing key points
- ✅ Solution: Practice 10+ times, record yourself, get feedback

**❌ Pitfall 10: No Backup Plan**
- Demo breaks = panic
- No recovery strategy
- ✅ Solution: Pre-generated results, video backup, screenshots

### Business Pitfalls

**❌ Pitfall 11: Unclear Problem Statement**
- "We use AI to help SaaS companies..."
- Too vague, no urgency
- ✅ Solution: "$50K-$500K lost annually to recoverable churn"

**❌ Pitfall 12: No Quantified Impact**
- "Our solution works better..."
- How much better?
- ✅ Solution: "15-25% win-back rate vs 1-2% baseline = 12x improvement"

**❌ Pitfall 13: Weak Competitive Positioning**
- "We're like HubSpot but with AI..."
- Not differentiated enough
- ✅ Solution: "Only solution focused on post-churn recovery, not prevention"

**❌ Pitfall 14: Unrealistic Market Size**
- "Our TAM is $1 trillion..."
- Judges won't believe it
- ✅ Solution: "$2.5B SAM with clear methodology"

## Appendix D: Judging Question Preparation

### Anticipated Technical Questions

**Q: "Why did you choose Amazon Bedrock over OpenAI?"**
A: "Bedrock is required for the hackathon, but also provides enterprise benefits: AWS integration, data privacy, model choice, and managed infrastructure. For production, Bedrock's AWS-native approach means better security and compliance."

**Q: "How do you handle Bedrock API failures?"**
A: "We implement retry logic with exponential backoff, graceful degradation to fallback prompts, and comprehensive error logging. For the demo, we also have pre-generated results as backup."

**Q: "Can this scale to thousands of customers?"**
A: "Yes - Lambda auto-scales, S3 scales infinitely, and Bedrock handles concurrent requests. For production, we'd add batch processing, caching, and DynamoDB for faster queries. Current architecture handles 50 customers in 60 seconds, linear scaling gets us to 10,000 in 20 minutes."

**Q: "What about hallucinations or bad AI output?"**
A: "We use confidence scoring - only high-confidence outputs (85%+) auto-execute. Medium confidence gets monitored, low confidence requires human review. We also validate JSON schema and use temperature 0.3 for factual analysis to reduce hallucinations."

**Q: "Why not use fine-tuning?"**
A: "For MVP, prompt engineering provides faster iteration and works well with limited data. Fine-tuning requires thousands of examples. Our roadmap includes fine-tuning once we have sufficient production data from pilot customers."

### Anticipated Business Questions

**Q: "How do you know companies will pay for this?"**
A: "We've identified a $2.5B market of companies losing $50K-$500K annually. Our solution provides 12x improvement with clear ROI. We'll validate with 10-15 pilot customers in months 1-3, offering free implementation + $500/month for 6 months to prove value."

**Q: "What about HubSpot and Salesforce - won't they build this?"**
A: "They focus on churn prevention (predicting who might leave). We focus on recovery (winning back those who already left). Different problem, different AI approach. Plus, we integrate with them rather than replace them, making adoption easier."

**Q: "How do you acquire customers?"**
A: "Phase 1: Direct outreach to 100+ SaaS companies, leverage team's networks (AWS, Yelp). Phase 2: Content marketing on revenue recovery, HubSpot/Salesforce marketplace listings. Phase 3: Channel partnerships with customer success consultants."

**Q: "What's your defensibility?"**
A: "Our moat comes from: (1) specialized AI agents trained on churn recovery patterns, (2) proprietary data from thousands of win-back campaigns, (3) integration partnerships, (4) customer switching costs once integrated. Not easily replicable."

**Q: "Why will customers churn from you?"**
A: "Good question - we'll measure our own product-market fit rigorously. Keys to retention: (1) demonstrable ROI in first 30 days, (2) seamless integrations that become workflow-critical, (3) continuous improvement from AI learning, (4) proactive customer success."

### Anticipated Design Questions

**Q: "Why this UI design?"**
A: "We prioritized clarity over flash - customer success teams need to quickly review campaigns. Clean cards, confidence scores prominently displayed, one-click drill-down to details. Design influences decision-making: high confidence = trust the AI, low confidence = review carefully."

**Q: "How do users trust the AI's decisions?"**
A: "Transparency is key. We show: (1) churn category with reasoning, (2) confidence score, (3) key insights that informed the campaign, (4) ability to review before sending. Users can see 'why' the AI made each decision."

**Q: "What if the email sounds robotic?"**
A: "We use temperature 0.7 for natural language generation, include human personality in prompts ('warm but professional'), and validate output quality. In production, we'd A/B test different tones and let customers customize brand voice."
