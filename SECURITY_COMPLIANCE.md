## 🔐 Security Architecture

### Data Encryption
- **At Rest:** AES-256 encryption via AWS S3 (enabled in production)
- **In Transit:** TLS 1.3 via HTTPS (CloudFront + API Gateway)
- **Keys:** AWS-managed keys (upgradeable to customer-managed KMS)

### Authentication & Access Control
- **Identity Provider:** AWS Cognito
  - Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
  - Password policies enforcement
  - SSO integration (SAML/OIDC for enterprise)
- **Data Isolation:** Per-user S3 prefixes with IAM policies
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Resource-level IAM permissions

### Audit & Monitoring
- **CloudTrail:** Full audit log of all API calls
- **CloudWatch:** Real-time monitoring and alerts
- **GuardDuty:** Automated threat detection
- **Retention:** 90-day log retention (configurable)

### Network Security
- **API Gateway:** AWS WAF for DDoS protection
- **Serverless Architecture:** No exposed servers or databases
- **VPC:** Optional private networking for enterprise customers

## 🌍 Privacy & Compliance

### GDPR Compliance
✅ **Data Processing Agreement:** AWS GDPR-compliant DPA  
✅ **Data Residency:** EU region deployment (eu-west-1) available  
✅ **Right to Access:** Data export API  
✅ **Right to Deletion:** 72-hour deletion SLA  
✅ **Privacy by Design:** Minimal data collection  
✅ **Consent Management:** User consent tracking  

### Data Protection
- **PII Handling:** Encrypted storage, access logging, automatic deletion
- **Data Retention:** Active subscription period + 30 days
- **Third-party AI:** AWS Bedrock (data NOT used for training)
- **No Data Sharing:** Customer data never sold or shared

### Certifications & Standards
| Certification | Status | Timeline |
|--------------|--------|----------|
| AWS SOC 2 (inherited) | ✅ Active | Immediate |
| AWS ISO 27001 (inherited) | ✅ Active | Immediate |
| GDPR Compliance | 🟡 In Progress | 2-3 weeks |
| SOC 2 Type II (own) | 📅 Planned | 6-12 months |
| HIPAA (optional) | 🟡 Available | 2-4 weeks |

## 🤖 AI Data Privacy

### AWS Bedrock Guarantees
✅ **No Training on Customer Data:** AWS does not use prompts or outputs for model training  
✅ **No Data Retention:** Prompts and outputs are not stored by AWS  
✅ **Regional Processing:** Data processed within selected AWS region  
✅ **HIPAA Eligible:** With Business Associate Agreement (BAA)  
✅ **Enterprise Ready:** Built for compliance from day one  

### Why Bedrock vs OpenAI?
| Feature | AWS Bedrock | OpenAI API |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Training opt-out | Automatic ✅ | Manual request ⚠️ |
| Data residency | AWS region choice ✅ | US-only ❌ |
| HIPAA eligible | Yes ✅ | No ❌ |
| SOC 2 inherited | Yes ✅ | Partial ⚠️ |
| Enterprise DPA | Included ✅ | Separate ⚠️ |

**Architectural Decision:** We chose AWS Bedrock specifically for enterprise compliance requirements.

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### What We Do
✅ Encryption at rest and in transit  
✅ Multi-factor authentication  
✅ Principle of least privilege IAM  
✅ Regular security audits  
✅ Automated threat detection  
✅ Incident response procedures
