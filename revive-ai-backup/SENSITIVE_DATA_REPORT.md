# Sensitive Data Audit Report

**Purpose:** Identify all AWS-specific data in the repository that may need to be sanitized before public GitHub submission.

---

## üîç Findings

### 1. AWS Account ID: `292101577831`

**Location:** Found in files that will be **DELETED** during cleanup ‚úÖ

```
‚úÖ ./step_functions/temp.json (will be deleted)
‚úÖ ./step_functions/state_machine.json (will be deleted)
‚úÖ ./step_functions/state_machine_final.json (will be deleted)
‚úÖ ./bedrock-agent/simple-flow.json (will be deleted)
‚úÖ ./bedrock-agent/MODEL_ACCESS_FIX.md (will be archived)
‚úÖ ./bedrock-agent/TROUBLESHOOTING.md (will be archived)
```

**Remaining files:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  ./bedrock-agent/agent-permissions-policy.json
‚ö†Ô∏è  ./bedrock-agent/flow-definition.json
```

**Recommendation:**
- Replace with `<YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>` in the 2 remaining files
- These are IAM policy templates, not secrets

---

### 2. API Gateway ID: `65rpczwxta`

**Location:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  ./frontend/index.html (PRODUCTION CODE - needs to work!)
üìù ./SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md (documentation)
üìù ./REPO_STRUCTURE.md (documentation)
```

**Analysis:**
- **frontend/index.html:** This is production code. If sanitized, the app won't work.
- **Documentation:** Shows it's a working demo

**Recommendation - Option A (Keep Demo Working):**
- Keep in `frontend/index.html` (required for app to function)
- Keep in documentation (shows it's a real deployment)
- Add note in README: "Live demo available at [URL]"

**Recommendation - Option B (Full Sanitization):**
- Replace with `<YOUR_API_GATEWAY_ID>` in all files
- Add deployment instructions for users to set their own
- Demo becomes code-only, not live

---

### 3. S3 Frontend URL: `http://revive-ai-frontend.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com`

**Location:**
```
üìù ./demo_data/SHOWCASE_EXAMPLES.md
üìù ./REPO_STRUCTURE.md
üìù ./SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md
üìù ./QUICKSTART.md (will be archived)
üìù ./DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md (will be archived)
```

**Analysis:**
- This is a public S3 website URL (not sensitive)
- Shows it's a working demo

**Recommendation - Option A (Keep Demo Working):**
- Keep in all documentation
- Add prominent link in README to live demo

**Recommendation - Option B (Full Sanitization):**
- Replace with `http://<your-s3-bucket>.s3-website-<region>.amazonaws.com`
- Remove live demo links

---

### 4. Other AWS Resources (Agent IDs, etc.)

**Bedrock Agent IDs:**
- `HAKDC7PY1Z` - ChurnAnalyzer agent
- `TSTALIASID` - Test alias
- `WN63LBEVKR` - Agent alias

**Location:** Throughout documentation and code

**Analysis:** These are resource identifiers, not secrets. They're needed to show the real implementation.

**Recommendation:** Keep (not sensitive)

---

## üéØ Recommended Actions

### Option A: Keep Live Demo (Recommended for Hackathon)

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Reviewers can test the live system
- ‚úÖ Shows it's production-ready, not just code
- ‚úÖ More impressive for hackathon submission

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Exposes your AWS account ID (not a security risk, just public)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  May incur AWS costs if abused (set billing alerts!)

**Actions:**
1. ‚úÖ Keep all URLs and IDs as-is
2. ‚úÖ Add prominent "Live Demo" section in README
3. ‚úÖ Add billing alert in AWS (e.g., $10/month threshold)
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è  Replace account ID in IAM policy templates only
5. ‚úÖ Add note: "This is a demo deployment. See deployment guide to set up your own."

---

### Option B: Full Sanitization (For Post-Hackathon)

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ No AWS account exposure
- ‚úÖ Encourages users to deploy their own

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå No live demo for reviewers
- ‚ùå Less impressive (just code)

**Actions:**
1. Replace all URLs with placeholders
2. Update deployment instructions to be comprehensive
3. Add demo video/screenshots instead of live demo

---

## üìù Sanitization Script (If Choosing Option B)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Run this to sanitize all sensitive data

cd /Users/elvischen/Documents/PROJECTS/AWS\ AI\ Agent\ Global\ Hackathon/revive-ai

# Replace AWS Account ID
find . -type f \( -name "*.json" -o -name "*.md" \) -exec sed -i '' 's/292101577831/<YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>/g' {} +

# Replace API Gateway ID
find . -type f \( -name "*.html" -o -name "*.md" -o -name "*.js" \) -exec sed -i '' 's/65rpczwxta/<YOUR_API_GATEWAY_ID>/g' {} +

# Replace S3 bucket name
find . -type f \( -name "*.html" -o -name "*.md" -o -name "*.js" \) -exec sed -i '' 's/revive-ai-frontend/<YOUR_BUCKET_NAME>/g' {} +

echo "‚úÖ Sanitization complete"
echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  Don't forget to update deployment instructions!"
```

---

## üéØ My Recommendation: **Option A (Keep Live Demo)**

**Reasoning:**
1. This is a hackathon submission - showing a working demo is powerful
2. AWS account ID is not sensitive (it's just an identifier)
3. API Gateway and S3 URLs are public anyway (CORS is configured)
4. You can always sanitize later after the hackathon
5. Set a billing alert ($10/month) to prevent abuse

**Quick Actions:**
1. ‚úÖ Add billing alert in AWS Console ($10 threshold)
2. ‚úÖ Update README with prominent "Live Demo" section
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è  Sanitize ONLY the 2 IAM policy template files (replace account ID with placeholder)
4. ‚úÖ Add note in README: "Live demo available for hackathon evaluation"

---

## üîí Security Notes

**What's Safe to Keep Public:**
- ‚úÖ API Gateway URL (already public, CORS-protected)
- ‚úÖ S3 website URL (already public, read-only)
- ‚úÖ Bedrock Agent IDs (resource identifiers, not secrets)
- ‚úÖ Lambda function names (just names, not ARNs with account ID)

**What to Sanitize:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  AWS Account ID in IAM policy templates (not a secret, but good practice)
- ‚ùå Never commit: API keys, secrets, credentials (none found ‚úÖ)

**What's Already Protected:**
- ‚úÖ No hardcoded credentials found
- ‚úÖ No API keys in code
- ‚úÖ No .env files committed
- ‚úÖ .gitignore properly configured
