---

## ðŸŽ¯ What Was Added

The Churn Analyzer agent now has **5 tools total** (was 2, added 3 new):

### Original Tools:
1. âœ… `analyzeChurn` - NLP analysis of churn reasons
2. âœ… `calculateCLV` - Customer lifetime value calculation

### NEW External Tools:
3. âœ… **`checkProductRoadmap`** - Internal knowledge base
4. âœ… **`getCRMHistory`** - Internal system integration
5. âœ… **`searchCompanyInfo`** - External web intelligence

---

## ðŸ“Š Tool Details

### 1. checkProductRoadmap (Internal Knowledge Base)
**Purpose:** Access internal product roadmap to see if upcoming features solve customer's churn reason

**Data Source:** `s3://revive-ai-data/knowledge/product-roadmap.json`

**Example Intelligence:**
```json
{
  "feature": "API v2.0 with Enhanced Rate Limits",
  "release_date": "2025-02-15",
  "status": "in_development",
  "benefits": [
    "10,000 requests/minute (up from 1,000)",
    "Average response time < 100ms"
  ],
  "solves_churn_reasons": ["performance", "features", "technical_limitations"]
}
```

**Agent Use Case:**
- Customer churned due to "API rate limits too low"
- Agent checks roadmap â†’ Finds API v2 launching Feb 15
- Campaign can say: "We're launching API v2 next month with 10x rate limits - perfect timing!"

---

### 2. getCRMHistory (Internal CRM Integration)
**Purpose:** Retrieve actual customer usage patterns, support tickets, and engagement metrics

**Data Source:** `s3://revive-ai-data/knowledge/crm-history.json`

**Example Intelligence:**
```json
{
  "usage_summary": {
    "months_active": 22,
    "usage_trend": "increasing",
    "recent_growth": "+35%",
    "feature_adoption": {
      "api_usage": "95%",
      "dashboard": "60%"
    }
  },
  "support_summary": {
    "recent_tickets": [
      {
        "subject": "API rate limits hitting ceiling",
        "sentiment": "frustrated"
      }
    ]
  },
  "churn_risk_flags": [
    "Rate limit complaints (3 times in 2 months)",
    "Growth trajectory exceeding current tier"
  ]
}
```

**Agent Use Case:**
- Customer said: "Too expensive"
- CRM shows: Only 20% feature adoption, no integration setup
- Agent insight: "Not price-sensitive - wrong product fit, needs better onboarding"

**Cross-Reference Intelligence:**
- What customer SAID vs. what they ACTUALLY did
- Reveals true churn reasons beyond stated reason
- Identifies upsell opportunities that were missed

---

### 3. searchCompanyInfo (External Web Intelligence)
**Purpose:** Real-time web search for company news, funding, growth, business status

**Data Source:** Web Search API (Mock for demo, easily replaced with SerpAPI/Tavily)

**Example Intelligence:**
```json
{
  "recent_news": [
    {
      "title": "DataTech Solutions Secures $15M Series A Funding",
      "date": "2025-09-15",
      "source": "TechCrunch",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    }
  ],
  "company_info": {
    "funding_stage": "Series A",
    "size": "50-100 employees",
    "growth_trajectory": "rapid_growth"
  }
}
```

**Agent Use Case:**
- Web search shows company just raised $15M funding
- They're growing 200% YoY
- Agent insight: "High-value target, can afford upgrade, perfect timing for premium campaign"

**Business Intelligence:**
- Is company still in business?
- Recent funding rounds (can they afford to come back?)
- Growth signals (are they scaling?)
- Industry trends

## ðŸ¤– How Agents Use These Tools

### Multi-Source Intelligence Gathering:

**Example Workflow:**
```
Customer: "c025 - DataTech Solutions churned due to API rate limits"

Agent Process:
1. calculateCLV â†’ CLV: $89,976, Priority: HIGH
2. getCRMHistory â†’
   - 22 months active
   - 95% API usage, +35% growth last 3 months
   - 3 support tickets about rate limits in 2 months
   - Should have been upsold to Enterprise
3. checkProductRoadmap â†’
   - API v2 launching Feb 15, 2025
   - 10x rate limits, <100ms response time
   - PERFECT solution to their churn reason
4. searchCompanyInfo â†’
   - Just raised $15M Series A (Sept 2025)
   - Growing 200% YoY
   - Expanding team - they can afford us!

Agent Recommendation:
"CRITICAL WIN-BACK OPPORTUNITY:
- High-value customer ($90K CLV) with rapid growth
- Real churn reason: Outgrew current tier (not informed of upgrade path)
- TIMING: API v2 launches in 60 days - solves exact problem
- INTELLIGENCE: Just raised $15M - budget is not an issue
- STRATEGY: Premium campaign + executive outreach + early API v2 access
- OFFER: Upgrade to Enterprise + beta access to API v2 + dedicated CSM"
```

## ðŸŽ¬ Demo Impact

### Before (2 tools):
"Customer churned. CLV is $90K. Recommend automated campaign."

### After (5 tools):
"Customer churned due to API limits. BUT:
- CRM shows they're growing 35%/month
- They just raised $15M funding (web search)
- We're launching API v2 in 60 days that solves this (roadmap)
- They should have been upsold but we missed it (CRM flags)

RECOMMENDATION: High-touch executive campaign offering early API v2 access + Enterprise upgrade. This is a $90K CLV customer in hyper-growth mode - we can't lose them."
