## Customer 1: HealthTech Pro 🏥
**Type:** Onboarding/Adoption Challenge
**MRR:** $4,999 (Enterprise)
**Customer ID:** c501

2. **Intelligent Root Cause Analysis**: The AI goes beyond surface-level reasons:
   - "Complexity" → Identifies adoption issue
   - "Budget constraints" → Pure pricing concern
   - "Missing features" → Product gap

3. **Context-Aware Strategy**: Different strategies for different situations:
   - Low adoption → Training & implementation
   - Budget concerns → Financial incentives
   - Feature gaps → Product roadmap preview
